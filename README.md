<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/ChengCK18/parker-flutter/blob/main/readme_docs/p1.gif" alt="Login into main page"  height="600"/>
</p>

The main motivation for this project is from living in a town where parking spots are limited and double parkings are frequent events. Long car horn ensues to get the double parker's attention. 

This mobile application is meant to be a bridge for simple communication with other drivers (such as double parkers). The current version of the application provides the basic core functionality of "alerting" other drivers given only their number plate(provided they are registed on the application as well). This application requires registration with an email only which is not publicly visible, hence avoiding the need to share phone numbers with strangers for data privacy reasons.
